Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: 
What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

I have received the base code that set up the environment and so on. The code I have created myself is the code behind the ML model, that learns by exploring the options and then allows the problem to be solved.


Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists study what can be calculated/solved by using computers. This brings a whole new level for human development, that before computers relied only on our own capacity to produce discoveries, now computers can be used for that as well. There are people saying that eventually this capacity of solving problems will become a commodity, which for me is amazing and just weird to think about.


How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I first try to understand what the flow of information must be. I then try to categorize the problem I am solving as a version of other problems that were solved before. Usually this is enough to solve most of the problems, but sometimes I will need to be more creative. This is one approach, but there is another approach, that is made possible by ML, that you tell the computer what you want to solve, and the computer learns to solve it on its own.


What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

To be as transparent and as collaborative as I can. I believe that this is the best way to minimize ethical problems.
